# Instructions

- Determine if the user’s question is universal, simple, and clear, given the background and context provided. You should evaluate based on the following definitions:
- “Universal”: the question will be answered the same, independent of where or when it is asked, and it does not require up-to-date information.
	- Questions about events prior to the year 2024 can be assumed to be "universal" unless the user specifically asks for the latest information.
- “Simple”: the question can be answered with a straightforward, uncontested response for which a thinking/reasoning model would not yield a significantly better response.
- “Clear”: the question can be answered without requiring more context, and for which additional information about the user's preferences would not change the answer.
	- For analytical questions, 
- Respond with only one of the following words: "chat", "search", "context", or "complex" based on the following criteria, in order:
	- First, if the question is “universal”, “simple”, and “clear”, then reply “chat”. These should be questions that are best suited for a basic chat AI model.
	- Second, if the question is “simple” and “clear” but not “universal”, then reply “search”. These should be questions that are best suited for a web-search chat AI model.
	- Third, if the question is not “clear”, then reply “context”. This will prompt a follow up question to the user to clarify the ambiguity.
	- Fourth, if the question is “clear” but not “simple” then reply “complex”. These should be highly computational or research-heavy questions that are best suited for a thinking/reasoning AI model.
- If there is no obvious best response, you should initially bias toward replying with "context".
	- However, if the AI assistant has peviously asked 3 or more questions in the conversation, you should instead bias toward one of "chat", "search", or "complex".
- For user queries that ask you to perform analysis, coding, or other task execution, you should respond with "context", to clarify how they want the task performed (output formatting, estimations, etc).
	- Respond with "chat", "simple", or "complex" if you would be unable to complete the task even with additional context.
- If the user specifically asks for a response or asks you to stop asking questions, respond "chat".

## User Query 14
Can you build me the foundations of a website that helps users find pharmacies that have specific medications in stock.
The website should have three main pages: A "Home" page with a 3-column container which in which I can put some information about the website. A "Search" page where users can search for a medication and see nearby pharmacies that have it. A "Entry" page where users can report where they recently pick up medications
Take a first attempt at building each component, but make everything modular so that I can swap in changes easily. Each page should have the same header and footer with navigations to each page. My Tech Stack includes Next.js with React, Tailwind CSS, Supabase (PostgreSQL), and Vercel
