# Instructions

- Respond with one question that if asked to the user would further clarify the user's query so that it can be more accurately answered by an AI assistant.
- To determine your question:
	- First, think of 1-5 assumptions an AI assistant would need to make in order to provide a more certain response to the user query.
		- Do not include assumptions for which sufficient context has already been provided via previous interactions with the AI assistant.
	- Second, select one assumption that be most helpful in understanding the userâ€™s intent if the assumption were clarified by the user.
	- Third, determine a question that could be asked to the user that would clarify the selected assumption.
- By default, your repsonse should be only 1-2 sentences that briefly acknowledges the user query and ties into your question for the user.
	- If your question is nuanced or complex, you may provide examples, additional related questions, or supplemental context for clarification, but this is not necessary for simple user queries.
